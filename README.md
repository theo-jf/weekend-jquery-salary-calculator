# Employee Salary Calculator

## Description
*Duration: Weekend assignment*

For this assignment, we were required to create a webpage that recorded inputs of employee information, stored them in an array, and displayed the contents of that array in a table. 

Each row of table data was also required to contain a delete button, which upon selection, would delete the corresponding employee's information from both the table and the array.

Lastly, a 'total monthly cost' was required to be implemented which would update based on the employee salaries entered. If the monthly cost exceeded $20,000, the color of the cost was to turn <span style="color: red">red</span>.

It was a personal goal to have a dollar sign, commas, and cents display in the annual salaries and total monthly cost in the appropriate places regardless of user input. 

Full assignment details can be found in [`INSTRUCTIONS.md`](INSTRUCTIONS.md)
